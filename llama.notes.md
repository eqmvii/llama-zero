>>> Hello! Please generate a short haiku about butterflies.
Gossamer wings dance,  

Colors flutter in the breeze—    

Butterflies take flight.  


This traditional Japanese form captures the essence and movement of butterflies through nature's lens. The haiku reflects on their delicate beauty as they move gracefully, an 
emblem of transformation echoing life’s fleeting moments.
